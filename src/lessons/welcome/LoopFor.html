<h2>For loops</h2>

<p class="Python">Warning, this lesson is currently written in Java only. Adapt it yourself</p>

<p>While loops are well adapted to situations where you want to achieve an
action while a condition stays true, but it is less adapted to achieve a
given action a predetermined amount of time. For example, when we wanted to
move <code>stepAmount</code> steps backward in previous exercise, you had to
create a new variable, initialize it, and move backward until the new
variable became equal to <code>stepAmount</code>, incrementing the new
variable manually at the end of the loop.</p> 

<p>In such situations, <code>for</code> loops become handy. Their syntax is the
following: 
<pre>for (<b>initializing</b>; <b>condition</b>; <b>incrementing</b>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>action</b>();
}</pre>

This code is perfectly equivalent to the following:
<pre><b>initializing</b>;
while (<b>condition</b>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>action</b>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>incrementing</b>;
}</pre>

<p>In such situations, <code>for</code> loops become handy. Their syntax is the

<pre><b>initializing</b>;
while (<b>condition</b>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>action</b>();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>incrementing</b>;
}</pre>

<p>For example, both following codes are equivalent. The latter is easier to
read, don't you think?

<pre>int done = 0;
while (done &lt; stepAmount) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backward();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done++;
}</pre>
<pre>for (int done = 0; done &lt; stepAmount; done++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backward();
}</pre>

<p>It is possible to build more advanced <tt>for</tt> loops since any valid
instruction can be used as initialization, condition and incrementation. The
following example is a bit extrem since it compute the gcd (greatest common
divisor) of two numbers without loop body and initialization (everything is
in the condition and incrementation).

<pre>int x=20, y=3, tmp;
for (; y!=0 ; tmp=x, x=y, y=tmp%y) { }
 <span class="comment">/* the gcd is stored in x */</span></pre>

<p>If you don't understand every details of this example, don't panic. That's
quite logic since it uses some syntax details that we did not introduce yet.</p>


<h3>Exercise goal</h3><a name="Objectives"> You now have to redo the same exercise than previously
(move forward until being over a baggle, pick it up, move back to your
original location, drop the baggle), but using a <tt>for</tt> loop instead
of a <tt>while</tt> loop to move back to the initial location.

<p>Once done, proceed to next exercise.</p>
