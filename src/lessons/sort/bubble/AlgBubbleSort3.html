<h1>BubbleSort and variations</h1>

<h2>BubbleSort3</h2>

<p>Let's now reintroduce the little optimization we removed at previous step:
if a traversal does not swap any element, it means that the array is already
sorted.</p>

<div class="tip" id="tip-3" alt="Show Tip (Pseudo-code)">
<p>The pseudo-code of the BubbleSort3 algorithm is the following:</p>
<pre>For all i in [len-2,0] (traversing from biggest to smallest)
       For all j in [0, i]
          If cells j and j+1 must be swapped, do it
       If traversal on j did not swap anything, return from the function
</pre>
</div>

<p>This optimization is even more disappointing: it only provide a gain of a few
percents on the amount of reads over BubbleSort2.</p>
