<h1>HanoiWorld</h1>

This world implements the ultra-classical Hanoi problem. You are asked
to move the disk pile from the stick where they are to the target
stick (given as second parameter in the world's name -- number 1 for
the default world). There is some extra constraint: you can only move
one disk at a time, and you cannot move a big disk over a smaller one.

Only 2 functions are provided:

<pre>public void move(int src, int dst) throws HanoiInvalidMove;</pre>

It moves one disk from the stick <code>src</code> onto the stick
<code>dst</code>. As you can see, if you try to do an invalid move (like
laying a disk over a smaller one), an exception is thrown.

<pre>int getSlotSize(int slot);</pre>

It returns the amount of disks placed on the specified slot. This is mainly 
used to initialize the recursion and set the amount of recursive call to execute.
