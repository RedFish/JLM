The pedagogical material distributed with JLM is also covered by the

In addition, the artwork is also free. The artwork we did ourselves
(such as the wonderful JLM logo) is distributed under the CC-BY-SA
license. The rest was borowed from open clip art and other project
gathering free artwork, as follows. For most of the pictures, we did
unfortunately not write done their source. Here are the info we have:

* The turtle was borowed from the kturtle project, from KDE edu.
* The bunny and egg in BuggleQuest universe come from:
  http://openclipart.org/detail/23052/
  http://openclipart.org/detail/93979/

We should probably replace the other for which we lost the copyright
information. But as you can see from the rest of the project, we are
better programmers than designers... You are welcome if you can help.
